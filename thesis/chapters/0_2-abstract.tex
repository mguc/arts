\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis deals with the problem of generating test data for indoor localization and mapping systems using acoustic sources (speakers) and receivers (microphones) in a given environment.
In particular methods of ray tracing and ultrasonic path evaluation will be explored and presented.
The suggested methods have been implemented in an Acoustic Ray Tracing Simulator (ARTS).
\newline ARTS is able to generate test sample data for a set of receivers by approximating the propagation of sound waves from acoustic sources as rays in a 3D modeled environment.
The geometry of the environment is provided by 3D data from tools which support the Wavefront OBJ file format.
Using this data and the geometric ray tracing method, reflections up to third order are being computed and sampled at the receivers end.
The sampled data can then be used in localization or mapping systems to evaluate different environments and setups.
