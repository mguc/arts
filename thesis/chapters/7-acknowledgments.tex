First and foremost, I would like to thank my loving and amazing wife Livia.
She has been supportive in every possible way and for that I will always be grateful.\newline
I want to thank \firstexaminer{} for giving me the opportunity to work on such an interesting and challenging topic. His inputs and presentations were really inspiring and gave me the right direction to follow.\newline
Furthermore I would like to thank the members of the ILDARS team for giving me important inputs when I started my thesis.\newline
I also want to thank \secondexaminer{} for agreeing to take the position as second examiner on short notice.\newline
Last but not least I would like to thank my friends Vasili Massaras and Mike Fischer for proofreading this thesis and dealing with my silly English mistakes.
